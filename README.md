### ProtInteract Datasets 

This repo includes the datasets used to develop the ProtInteract framework, a deep learning framework to predict protein-protein interaction.

The datasets used to train the ProtInteract framework for protein-protein interaction can be downloaded from the following link. These datasets are retrieved from the [STRING database][3] for Homo sapiens and Mus musculus organisms and processed for the training the ProtInteract framework.

1- The ["Protein_Sequences"][1] contains amino acid sequences of Homo sapiens and Mus musculus organisms available on the STRING database. 

2- The ["PPI_datasets"][2] contains protein-protein interaction sets of Homo sapiens and Mus musculus organisms available on the STRING database, with their respective interaction score.
