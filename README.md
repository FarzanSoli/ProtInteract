This repo includes the datasets used to develop the ProtInteract framework, a deep learning framework to predict protein-protein interaction.

The datasets used to train the ProtInteract framework for protein-protein interaction can be downloaded from the following link. These datasets are retrieved from the STRING database for Homo sapiens and Mus musculus organisms and processed for the training the ProtInteract framework.

The "Protein_Sequences" folder contains amino acid sequences of Homo sapiens and Mus musculus organisms available on the STRING database. 
The "PPI_datasets" contains protein-protein interaction sets of Homo sapiens and Mus musculus organisms available on the STRING database, with their respective interaction score.
